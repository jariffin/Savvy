              <p>Jute is obtained from the bark of the white jute plant, which requires plenty of water (usually rain) to grow. Production of jute uses less chemicals, fertilizers, chemicals, dyes and bleaches, and its yield is 4 times more than flax per acre. Growing jute also improves soil conditions, and helps absorb and store large quantities of CO2. However, jute fibers are stiff and coarse, and its tensile strength is much lower than that of cotton and flax, complicating the production of soft and fine fabrics from jute.</p>

                <p>Soy fabric is made from the fibers of soy bean hulls. Soy requires more care than bamboo and hemp, (lots of water and pesticides), although GMO strains have also been developed. Deforestation to grow more soy is also a concern. Processing includes the use of formaldehyde which is a probable carcinogen (alternatives are being investigated). Unlike during production of bamboo and wood cellulose, the chemicals are reused for soy. Soy beans are also used to make tofu, so manufacturing fabric from it reduces waste. Producing this soft, cashmere-like fabric is still more sustainable than non-organic cotton, but care is needed to ensure it is grown sustainably.</p>

Nevertheless, producing the fibers is costly and labor intensive, and the fibers are treated with chemicals during production. Ramie fibers are very strong (even stronger when wet), but are not as durable as other fibers, so ramie is usually blended with cotton or wool.

              <h2>Feather Down</h2>
              <p>Eiderdown is very expensive and hand-collected after being shed by eider geese. However most down comes from geese, and is a byproduct of livestock farming that would otherwise be thrown away. Ethical concerns come from the practice of <%= link_to "live-plucking", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/winter-coat-ethically-produced-down-goose-feathers", :target => "_blank" %>, which can be done several times a year until the goose is slaughtered. Live-plucking is banned in the U.S and some European countries, but still occurs in some Eastern European countries and China. The alternative is synthetic filling in your blankets, which we do not recommend either. Therefore, look for ethical real down, or recycled real down for a more sustainable choice.</p>

                <h2>Leather</h2>
                <p>We'll be the first to admit, leather looks awesome. But non-eco friendly leather results in: methane emissions (livestock); deforestation; toxic chemicals from tanning (carcinogenic chromium, lead, arsenic and acids); polluted waterways. Tannery workers suffer from cancer, kidney and liver damage, and reproductive problems. Sustainable leather is a possibility, but leather alternatives derived from pineapples, grapes, mushrooms or seaweed are better!</p>
