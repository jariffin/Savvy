              <p>Growing hemp requires less water and pesticides than cotton. It also improves soil conditions and sequesters carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Nevertheless, processing hemp is less efficient and therefore costly, and it can be hard to dye.</p>

                <h2>Linen/Flax</h2>
                <p>Linen, made from flax fibres, dates back to as early as 4BC in ancient Egypt. Growing flax does not require pesticides or much water. Production of linen via a **closed loop production process without chemical retting, bleaching or dyeing is extremely eco-friendly. If you compost something made of undyed and unfinished linen, it will completely biodegrade.</p>

                <p>Like rayon, lyocell fabric is a made from wood cellulose, but differs in that it requires less chemical processing. Tencel®  is a brand of lyocell by the Austrian company, Lenzing AG, that processes GM-free, sustainably farmed trees (ie: beechwood) via **closed loop production. Lyocell does not need bleaching and uses less dye than cotton. Lyocell has also recently begun to be processed from bamboo, which grows fast without fertilisers or irrigation.</p>

              <h2>Jute</h2>
              <p>Jute is obtained from the bark of the white jute plant, which requires plenty of water (usually rain) to grow. Production of jute uses less chemicals, fertilizers, chemicals, dyes and bleaches, and its yield is 4 times more than flax per acre. Growing jute also improves soil conditions, and helps absorb and store large quantities of CO2. However, jute fibers are stiff and coarse, and its tensile strength is much lower than that of cotton and flax, complicating the production of soft and fine fabrics from jute. </p>

              <p>Piñatex™ is made from the fibers of pineapple leaves after harvesting the fruit from the pineapple crop, so no extra land, water or chemicals are needed to produce the material. It is a good vegan substitute for leather as it is strong and durable. The leftover leaves can be used ad fertilizer or biofuel so no wastage occurs.

              <h2>Nettle</h2>
              <p>Nettle grows like a weed in Europe, Africa and western North America, and is related to both hemp and flax. Like hemp and flax, it was historically used in Victorian times before cotton became as prevalent as it is today. Growing nettle requires minimal water and no pesticides. In fact, nettle can thrive in soil that is too barren for other crops (while also replenishing it with nutrients). The plant is used for many uses, with leftover stalk used for animal bedding, so growing it produces no waste.</p>

              <h2>Cotton (Organic)</h2>
              <p>Growing cotton requires a lot of water, chemicals and pesticides. Organic cotton involves avoiding chemicals and pesticides to reduce the impact on soil fertility and contamination of nearby bodies of water. To ensure the cotton is truly organic, third party certification is vital, as fake certificates have been used by big companies for 'greenwashing' and misleading marketing.</p>

Tannery workers suffer from cancer, kidney and liver damage, and reproductive problems. Sustainable leather is a possibility, but leather alternatives derived from pineapples, grapes, mushrooms or seaweed are better!</p>
